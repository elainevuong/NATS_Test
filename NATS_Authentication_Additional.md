Straight forward Setup
You can replace send and receive <- with nats publish and subscribe or - for added redundancy on the sign up service - queue subscribe. To do so, you will need connections that enable the sign up service as well as the requestor to exchange messages. The sign up service uses the same connection all of the time and (queue) subscribes to a well known subject. The requestor uses the connection and sends a request to the well known subject. Once the response is received the first connection is closed and the obtained JWT is used to establish a new connection.
Here in lies a chicken and and egg problem. The first connection to request the JWT itself needs credentials. The simplest approach is to set up a different NATS server/cluster that does not require authentication, connect first to cluster 1 and keep requesting the user JWT. Once obtained disconnect from cluster 1 and connect to cluster 2 using the obtained JWT.
